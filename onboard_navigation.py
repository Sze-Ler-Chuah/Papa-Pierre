DiplomacyDonutDinghy:    A small boat which is licensed to travel on diplomatic hyperlanes. So it moves extra

TeleportingTarteTrolley: A trolley bus that can teleport between any two cities if they are close enough, 
                         regardless of countries. Because teleportation technology is still in its infancy,
                         it takes time to program and execute a blink between two cities.
